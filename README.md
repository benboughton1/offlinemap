Windows executable Map Viewer


Setup process

1. Download and install OSGeo4W64 using Advanced install, ensure qgis, pyqt4 and others


This app is an adaptation of an application called 'Map Viewer' from the book 'Building Map Applications with QGIS', by Erik Westra and published by PACKT.

It is an excellent book that I highly recommend purchasing.

Currently the application works by running run.bat.

I aim to have it built to a Windows executable (exe) file but at the moment this fails which is main reason I have shared this repository, to try and have a simple example solution that I can leave online for reference.

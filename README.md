Windows executable Map Viewer


Proposed setup and build process

1. Download and install OSGeo4W64 using Advanced install, ensure qgis, pyqt4 and others
2. Install pyinstaller to OSGeo4W64 python27
3. Run create_exe.bat 

This app is an adaptation of an application called 'Map Viewer' from the book 'Building Map Applications with QGIS', by Erik Westra and published by PACKT.

It is an excellent book that I highly recommend purchasing.

I have also borrowed code from this GIS Stack Exchange answer: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/177488/working-windows-standalone-exe-from-qgis-python-script-using-pyinstaller

Currently the application works by running run.bat.

App now compiles to exe on Windows 10 machine with create_exe.bat.
